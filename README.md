## Building

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod/ChaosModV.git`

2. `cd ChaosModV`

3. Initialize all submodules

```
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

4. Open `vendor/minhook/build/VC15/MinHookVC15.sln` in Visual Studio

5. Compile libMinHook as x64 Release build

6. Open `ChaosMod.sln` in the root folder in Visual Studio

7. Compiling should work now. If there's an error referencing `MsBuildMajorVersion` when building either the ConfigApp or TwitchChatProxy projects, close and open Visual Studio again.

## Adding new effects

1. Add a new effect enum entry to `ChaosMod/Effects/EffectsInfo.h`

2. Create a new .cpp file in the appropriate folder under `ChaosMod/Effects/db/` with a fitting name

Layout of the file should look like this:

```cpp
/*
	Effect by <Your Name>
*/

#include <stdafx.h>

static void OnStart()
{
	
}

static void OnStop()
{
	
}

static void OnTick()
{
	
}

// Any of these functions can be omitted and either replaced with a `nullptr` or completely left out (default parameter values) in the `RegisterEffect` declaration
static RegisterEffect registerEffect(EFFECT_ENUM_ENTRY, OnStart, OnStop, OnTick, EffectInfo
	{
		// These are always required, you may have to add more designators depending on your effect
		.Name = "Generic Effect",
		.Id = "player_funny_stuff"
	}
);
```

3. Add the same info to `ConfigApp/Effects.cs`
